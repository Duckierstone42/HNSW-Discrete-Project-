# HNSW-Discrete-Project-
This repo contains the code for our implementation of the HNSW algorithm (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) for our CS 2051 Math paper.

I, Ankith, will eventually create a python file that measures the performance of a specific hnsw algorithm in querying a vector database for the nearest neighbours.
